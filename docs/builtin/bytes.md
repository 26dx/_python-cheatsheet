## Introduction

In Python, the `bytes` type is an immutable sequence of single bytes. It represents a sequence of integers in the range of 0 to 255, which can be used to represent binary data such as images, audio, or other types of files.

You can create a bytes object in several ways. One way is to use the `bytes()` constructor and pass it a string, a bytearray object, or a bytes object. For example:

```python
>>> data = "Hello, World!"
>>> bytes_obj = bytes(data, "utf-8")
>>> print(bytes_obj)
# b'Hello, World!'
```

Another way is to use a literal notation prefixing the string with `b` or `B`:

```python
data = b"Hello, World!"
print(data)
# b'Hello, World!'
```
