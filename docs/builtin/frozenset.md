## Introduction

The `frozenset()` function in Python is a built-in function that creates an immutable, hashable set from an iterable. Unlike a regular `set`, a `frozenset` cannot be modified after its creation, which means you cannot add or remove elements. This immutability makes it suitable for use as a dictionary key or as an element in another set.

## Examples

```python
>>> frozenset([1, 2, 3])
# frozenset({1, 2, 3})

>>> frozenset({1, 2, 3})
# frozenset({1, 2, 3})

>>> frozenset((1, 2, 3))
# frozenset({1, 2, 3})
```
