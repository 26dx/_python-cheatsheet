## Introduction

The `object()` function returns a new, empty, featureless object. This object is the base for all classes in Python. It doesn't have any special attributes or methods.

While you can create `object` instances, it's not something you'll do often in day-to-day programming. It's more of a fundamental building block of Python's object model.

### Example

```python
# Create a new object
o = object()

# See its type
print(type(o))  # Output: <class 'object'>

# It has no attributes you can set
# o.name = "test" # This would raise an AttributeError
```
