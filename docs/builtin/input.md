## Introduction

The `input()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows a program to read a line of text from the user's keyboard. It is an essential tool for creating interactive applications, as it pauses the program's execution and waits for the user to provide input. The function can also display a prompt to guide the user on what to enter.

## Examples

This function takes the input from the user and converts it into a string:

```python
>>> print('What is your name?')   # ask for their name
>>> my_name = input()
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
# What is your name?
# Martha
# Hi, Martha
```

`input()` can also set a default message without using `print()`:

```python
>>> my_name = input('What is your name? ')  # default message
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
# What is your name? Martha
# Hi, Martha
```
