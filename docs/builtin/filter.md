## Introduction

The `filter()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to process an iterable and extract those items that satisfy a certain condition. It returns an <router-link to="/builtin/iter">iterator</router-link> with the elements that meet the criteria.

## Syntax

```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

- **function**: The function to execute for each item in the iterable. It should return `True` or `False` for each item.
- **iterable**: The iterable to filter, such as a list, tuple, or string.

## Description

The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from those elements of the iterable for which the function returns `True`. If the function is `None`, it removes all elements of the iterable that are false.

## Example

```python
>>> def is_even(num):
...     return num % 2 == 0
...
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
>>> print(even_numbers)
>>> [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, the `is_even` function is defined to determine whether a number is even or not. The filter method takes `two arguments`: the `first argument` is the function to apply to each element of the list, and the `second argument` is the list to be filtered. The filter method returns an <router-link to="/builtin/iter">iterator</router-link>, which is then converted to a list and stored in the even_numbers variable. The final output is the list of even numbers from the original list.
