## Introduction

The `__import__()` function is the underlying function that is called by the `import` statement. While it's possible to use it directly, it's generally discouraged. For dynamically importing modules, the `importlib.import_module()` function is the recommended approach.

### Example

Here's how you could use `__import__()` to dynamically import the `math` module:

```python
# Dynamically import the 'math' module
math_module = __import__('math')

# Now you can use it like a regular import
print(math_module.sqrt(4))  # Output: 2.0
```

However, the recommended way using `importlib` is:

```python
import importlib

math_module = importlib.import_module('math')
print(math_module.sqrt(4)) # Output: 2.0
```
