## Introduction

The `hash()` function returns an integer representing the hash value of an object. This is primarily used by dictionaries to quickly look up keys.

Only "hashable" objects can be passed to `hash()`. An object is hashable if it has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime. All of Python's built-in immutable types (like strings, numbers, and tuples) are hashable, while mutable containers (like lists and dictionaries) are not.

### Examples

```python
# Hash of an integer is the integer itself
print(hash(1))      # Output: 1
print(hash(1.0))    # Output: 1 (1 and 1.0 are equal)

# Hash of a string (output varies)
print(hash('hello'))

# Hash of a tuple (output varies)
print(hash((1, 2, 3)))

# Trying to hash a list will raise a TypeError
try:
    hash([1, 2, 3])
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
# Output: unhashable type: 'list'
```
