## Introduction

The `id()` function returns a unique integer that identifies an object in memory. This ID is guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the object. It's essentially the memory address of the object.

### Examples

```python
x = 10
y = 10
z = 20

print(id(x))  # Output might be something like 4331368528
print(id(y))  # Output will be the same as id(x) because Python caches small integers
print(id(z))  # Output will be different
print(id(1))
print(id('1'))
print(id([1, 2]))
```
