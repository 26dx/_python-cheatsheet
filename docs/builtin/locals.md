## Introduction

The `locals()` function returns a dictionary representing the current local symbol table. This includes all local variables, arguments, and other objects in the current scope.

It's a useful tool for inspecting the local namespace.

### Example

```python
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(locals())

my_function("hello", "world")
# Output will be something like:
# {'arg1': 'hello', 'arg2': 'world', 'local_var': 'I am local'}
```
