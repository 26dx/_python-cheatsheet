## Introduction

The `getattr()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to access an object's attribute by its name, provided as a string. This is a powerful feature for dynamic programming, as it enables you to retrieve an attribute when its name is not known until runtime. You can also provide a default value to be returned if the attribute does not exist, which helps in avoiding errors.

## Syntax

```python
getattr(object, name)
```
or
```python
getattr(object, name, default)
```
-`object`: The object whose attribute you want to access.

-`name`: The name of the attribute you want to retrieve.

-`default`: (Optional) The value to be returned if the attribute is not found. If not provided, `None` is returned.

## Example

```python
class Example:
    attribute = "Hello, World!"

# Creating an instance of the class
obj = Example()

# Using getattr to access the attribute
value = getattr(obj, 'attribute', 'Nothing found')

print(value)  # Output: Hello, World!

# If the 'attribute' does not exist then 'Nothing found' will be printed.
```
